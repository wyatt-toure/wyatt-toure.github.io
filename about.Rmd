  <figcaption>This was taken by photographer Alex Tran as part of a project where researchers had their data projected back onto them. My face has traces generated from tracking a guppy with computer vision during a learning experiment. See more of Alex's work [here](https://alextran.ca/data-projections).

<div class="column-right">
I am broadly interested in **<span style="color: #153845;">evolutionary and behavioural biology.</span>**

I want to understand how species and individuals adapt to their environments through their behaviour by uncovering the mechanisms generating **<span style="color: #153845;">behavioural diversity</span>** and link this information to its **<span style="color: #153845;">ecological and evolutionary context</span>**.

In answering these questions I leverage **<span style="color: #153845;">Python programming</span>**, and **<span style="color: #153845;">computer vision</span>** to automate either the conduction of experiments or the collection of data or both, allowing me to collect high resolution data in a standardized manner. In addition to research I have interests in scientific media, producing short films and videos on various aspects of biology.
