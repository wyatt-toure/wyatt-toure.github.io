My face has traces generated from tracking a guppy with computer vision during a learning experiment. See more of Alex’s work here.\n\n\nI am broadly interested in evolutionary biology.\nI want to understand how species and individuals adapt to their environments by uncovering the molecular and developmental mechanisms generating adaptive phenotypes.\nIn answering these questions I leverage guppies, programming, and computer vision to automate either the conduction of experiments or the collection of data or both, allowing me to collect higher resolution positional data than I can by doing collection manually. In addition to research I have interests in scientific media, producing short films and videos on various aspects of biology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can see a few of my pieces below.\nThe first is a piece on ecological restoration I was able to make as a Jackson Wild Media Fellow.\nThe second is one of the first I ever made. It is about Isla Coiba, a former prison island off the Pacific coast of Panama, which is now a biodiversity sanctuary used for biology education and research purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sage Seed\nFor more than half a century, people have altered the ecosystem in the Kelly Hayfields of Grand Teton National Park. Historically, food for cattle was grown in the fields. Now, park scientists aim to bring back native plants and animals by undertaking rigorous restoration work. The story of the Kelly Hayfields demonstrates that present-day actions cascade into the future, and we may never see the outcome. As values shift and generations of land stewards come and go, it is clear that we must care about environmental consequences for those people, plants, and animals who will live in the future.\nBelow is a preview, the full video can be found here.\n\n  .vid{\n  max-width: 100%;\n}\nCoiba: From Prison to Biodiversity Sanctuary\nOnce a deadly prison on an Island meant to keep prisoners in, Coiba is now a biodiversity sanctuary. Its past as a penal colony means that the ecosystem was left undisturbed, inadvertently creating one of the most biologically pristine sites in Panama. Now students and interested peoples from around the world can come to Coiba to learn about biodiversity and the science that goes into understanding it.\nBelow is a preview, the full video can be found here.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI’d like to thank my team members on ‘The Sage Seed’, Alex Wiles, Sarika Khanwilkar, Reyhaneh Maktoufi who I worked together with to produce that video.\n\n\n\n",

It determines what a guppy will eat, who a guppy will mate with, and how likely a guppy is to be predated. Unlearned colour biases have been extensively documented within guppies, likely arising from the ecological and evolutionary importance of colour in guppy biology. However, it has not been demonstrated whether biases similarly influence what colours guppies learn about. In two experiments I documented consistent biases for green over blue in lab-reared wild-derived guppies. There’s some interesting literature implicating blue as a difficult colour for guppies to forage from as a result of constraints arising from either evolutionary or mechanistic constraints. More work would be needed to be sure.\nThis project is published as Toure, M. W., & Reader, S. M. (2021). Colour biases in learned foraging preferences in Trinidadian guppies. Ethology, 00, 1-12. You can read more supplementary details about this work at the website for the project at https://wyatt-toure.github.io/guppy-colour-learning/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomated behaviour quantification\n\n\n\nMy research involves collecting a lot of positional behavioural data but the manual collection of behavioural data can be time consuming and potentially prone to errors that are difficult to detect without repeating an already long process of manually measuring the positions of the animal. Automated tracking allows me to rapidly process behavioural data and obtain more detailed and reliable data.\nTo track animals automatically I use computer-vision scripts made via Python programming. A lot of software that tracks animals for researchers is either proprietary and expensive or very complex even though only a simple situation may be needed so I have put out a guide to making simple but powerful scripts which should be suitable for a number of common animal behaviour applications. The guide will be available soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomated behaviour experiments\n\n\n\nI supervised the Honour’s project of Beatriz Quineche. We (mainly Beatriz) designed an automatic experimental setup using a Raspberry Pi 4 and Python programming to automate the conduction of learning experiments in guppies. This was particularly useful given COVID restrictions meant lab access was limited — with this setup experiments could be conducted from home.\nTo validate whether learning was possible with this automated method, Beatriz conducted a simple proof-of-concept, classical conditioning learning experiment where fish would learn that a light stimulus predicts feeding time. We incorporated automated tracking to collect the data. You can learn more about this at the (currently incomplete) project site for the experiment: https://wyatt-toure.github.io/guppy-automated-learning-chamber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiential effects on exploratory behaviour\n\n\n\nTrinidadian guppies have been observed to vary consistently in their exploratory behaviour, defined as their responses to novelty. Their exploratory tendencies also tend to be correlated across contexts so a guppy that explores objects typically also explores novel areas and prefers novel mates.\nI am trying to examine whether there is a role for experience in the environment in shaping exploratory behaviour. Additionally, I am investigating whether there are impacts on behavioural plasticity due to behavioural correlations we observe across novelty contexts.\nYou can see an example of individual variation in guppy behaviour from some of my guppy data in the data animation to the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe genetics of brain size\n\n\n\nIn guppies, the expression level of a single gene, Ang-1 has been implicated in producing large brain size differences among guppy lines. However, this has only been demonstrated in guppies artificially selected for brain size. These changes in brain size lead to marked differences in cognitive performance with important consequences for reproductive success. However, it is unknown to what extent Ang-1 plays a role in natural brain size variation.\nAs part of an internship I am trying to determine whether natural variation in brain size can be explained by variation in Ang-1 expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
