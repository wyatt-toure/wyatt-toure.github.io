My face has traces generated from tracking a guppy with computer vision during a learning experiment. See more of Alex’s work here.\n\n\nI am broadly interested in evolutionary and behavioural biology.\nI want to understand how species and individuals adapt to their environments through their behaviour by uncovering the mechanisms generating behavioural diversity and link this information to its ecological and evolutionary context.\nIn answering these questions I leverage Python programming, and computer vision to automate either the conduction of experiments or the collection of data or both, allowing me to collect high resolution data in a standardized manner. In addition to research I have interests in scientific media, producing short films and videos on various aspects of biology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can see a few of my pieces below.\nThe first is a piece on ecological restoration I was able to make as a Jackson Wild Media Fellow.\nThe second is one of the first I ever made. It is about Isla Coiba, a former prison island off the Pacific coast of Panama, which is now a biodiversity sanctuary used for biology education and research purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sage Seed\nFor more than half a century, people have altered the ecosystem in the Kelly Hayfields of Grand Teton National Park. Historically, food for cattle was grown in the fields. Now, park scientists aim to bring back native plants and animals by undertaking rigorous restoration work. The story of the Kelly Hayfields demonstrates that present-day actions cascade into the future, and we may never see the outcome. As values shift and generations of land stewards come and go, it is clear that we must care about environmental consequences for those people, plants, and animals who will live in the future.\nBelow is a preview, the full video can be found here.\n\n  .vid{\n  max-width: 100%;\n}\nCoiba: From Prison to Biodiversity Sanctuary\nOnce a deadly prison on an Island meant to keep prisoners in, Coiba is now a biodiversity sanctuary. Its past as a penal colony means that the ecosystem was left undisturbed, inadvertently creating one of the most biologically pristine sites in Panama. Now students and interested peoples from around the world can come to Coiba to learn about biodiversity and the science that goes into understanding it.\nBelow is a preview, the full video can be found here.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI’d like to thank my team members on ‘The Sage Seed’, Alex Wiles, Sarika Khanwilkar, Reyhaneh Maktoufi who I worked together with to produce that video.\n\n\n\n",

Automated tracking allows me to rapidly process behavioural data and obtain more detailed and reliable data.\nTo track animals automatically I use computer-vision scripts made via Python programming. A lot of software that tracks animals for researchers is either proprietary and expensive or very complex even though only a simple situation may be needed so I have put out a guide to making simple but powerful scripts which should be suitable for a number of common animal behaviour applications. The guide will be available soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomated behaviour experiments\n\n\n\nI supervised the Honour’s project of Beatriz Quineche. We designed automated methods for conducting behavioural experiments in guppies. We designed an automatic feeder using a Raspberry Pi 4 and Python programming to automate the conduction of learning experiments in guppies.\nTo validate whether learning was possible with this automated method, Beatriz conducted a simple proof-of-concept, classical conditioning learning experiment where fish would learn that a light stimulus predicts feeding time. We incorporated automated tracking to collect the data. You can see the design of the apparatus, documentation for the Python code required to run the chamber, documentation for the R code to conduct the analysis on the data and sample footage of the learning chamber at this site: [coming soon].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiential effects on exploratory behaviour\n\n\n\nTrinidadian guppies have been observed to vary consistently in their exploratory behaviour, defined as their responses to novelty. Their exploratory tendencies also tend to be correlated across contexts so a guppy that explores objects typically also explores novel areas and prefers novel mates.\nI am trying to examine whether there is a role for experience in the environment in shaping exploratory behaviour. Additionally, I am investigating whether there are impacts on behavioural plasticity due to behavioural correlations we observe across novelty contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe genetics of brain size\n\n\n\nIn guppies, the expression level of a single gene, Ang-1 has been implicated in producing large brain size differences among guppy lines. However, this has only been demonstrated in guppies artificially selected for brain size. These changes in brain size lead to marked differences in cognitive performance with important consequences for reproductive success. However, it is unknown to what extent Ang-1 plays a role in natural brain size variation.\nAs part of an internship I am trying to determine whether natural variation in brain size can be explained by variation in Ang-1 expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
